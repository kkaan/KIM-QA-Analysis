> hi we want to refactor @Elekta\App_Static_loc.mlapp and @Elekta\Staticloc.m to python. The code takes in a 
centroid file with expected coordinates for the fiducials (Seeds) and centroid/isocentre. It also takes in the 
trajectory logs of the measured positions of the fiducials outputted by the KIM tracking software (which measures 
via fluroscopy the actual positions). We get graphical traces of the deviation with time. The @"Lyrebird Data\" 
folder contains the centroid file @"Lyrebird Data\Centroid_248687_BeamID_3.1_3.2.txt" and trajectory files. 

The matlab code requires the centroid file (sometime called patient file) to be stripped of everything but the 
values. Could the python code just handle this. The values will be in the same order.
